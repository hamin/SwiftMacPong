## SwiftMacPong

A Pong clone in Swift written with SpriteKit framework for OS X. This is essentially a Swift port of [Chris Ledet's Pong clone](https://github.com/chrisledet/Pong). I wanted to play with SpriteKit and Swift for Mac and decided to port an existing game.


### Requirements

* Mac OS X 10.9

### Controls

* Press `W` or `Arrow Up` to Move Up
* Press `S` or `Arrow Down` to Move Down
